# Loan_Disbursement_GBM

### Problem where you have to predict chances of a Loan approval of a customer based on their demographics, past Credit history etc.The goal of the exercise is to train a model which is robust enough (i.e not an overfitted model) to predict Loan prediction in future. Model building process involves trying multiple iterations( tuning the Model hyperparameters) so that we get a better model form the previous iterations. In the below exercises some of the iterations by varying the Model hyperparametrs have been tried by our end and for some part you have to try the model building by tuning the other different parameters and see whether improves over the previous iterations or not
